# SecretKeeper - AI Security Hardening

## Overview

SecretKeeper has been hardened to protect against AI prompt injection and red team attacks. This document outlines the security measures implemented to prevent AI-related security threats.

## AI Security Features

### 1. AI Security Middleware

The application now includes an `AISecurityMiddleware` that:

- Detects and blocks common prompt injection patterns
- Scans request bodies and query parameters for potentially harmful content
- Adds AI/LLM security headers to all responses
- Logs potential AI security threats

### 2. Client-Side Protection

- Added `ai_security.js` which implements:
  - Detection of prompt injection patterns in user inputs
  - Sanitization of potentially harmful content
  - Interception of form submissions to validate before sending
  - Enhanced fetch/XHR requests with AI security headers

### 3. Security Headers

Added several AI/LLM-specific security headers:

- `X-LLM-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Instructs LLM processing systems to block potential prompt injection
- `LLM-Processing-Policy: no-processing` - Indicates content should not be processed by AI systems
- `LLM-Context-Policy: no-external-context` - Prevents using content in AI training or other contexts
- `X-AI-Instructions: none; no-process; no-training; no-indexing` - Comprehensive directives for AI systems

### 4. Enhanced Content Security Policy

Extended the CSP headers with additional protections:
- `form-action 'self'` - Restricts form submissions to same origin
- `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` - Enforces trusted types for script execution
- `trusted-types default` - Establishes trusted type policy

### 5. Input Validation

- Added AI security validation in form submissions
- Implemented detection of potential prompt injection patterns in user inputs
- Enhanced server-side validation with prompt injection detection

## Threat Model

This implementation addresses the following threats:

1. **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Attempts to manipulate AI systems by injecting malicious prompts
2. **AI Manipulation**: Efforts to trick AI systems into bypassing security controls
3. **Data Extraction via AI**: Attempts to extract sensitive information through AI systems
4. **AI Training Abuse**: Prevention of using the application's data for unauthorized AI training

## Additional Security Measures

- **Logging**: Enhanced logging for potential AI security threats
- **Client-side Detection**: Real-time detection of suspicious patterns in user inputs
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection across client, server, and HTTP headers

## Ongoing Protection

These security measures represent the current best practices for protecting against AI-related threats. As the field evolves, the security implementation should be regularly updated to address new threats and techniques.
