3) Key flows & states
A) Create → Share

User types secret; chooses TTL (10 min default).

Encrypt in browser (AES-GCM) → POST ciphertext/IV/TTL only. App returns id.

App constructs link: https://app/s/{id}#k=<base64url-jwk>.

“Link created” toast + copy/QR. Use short, non-blocking toasts; persist if action needed. 
Carbon Design System

Microcopy: “Anyone with this link (including the part after #) can view the secret exactly once.”

B) Reveal (one-time)

/s/{id} loads a minimal HTML.

JS reads location.hash, fetches the ciphertext, atomically consumes record (Redis GETDEL if available; KV fallback tombstones), then decrypts locally and renders.

The page immediately switches the UI to “This link is now invalid” and hides the secret after the user navigates away or times out.

C) Expired/Consumed

Friendly message, a single CTA: “Create a new secret”.

Optional: display TTL countdown while viewing (purely client-side).

4) UI components (implementation notes)

Glass panel card (container for all content): 16px radius, subtle shadow, AA contrast for text. Use system fonts; 14–16px body, 20–24px heading. 
W3C
WebAIM

Textarea with live character count; warn at 10KB+ (rate-limit & size guard). 
OWASP

TTL selector: segmented control (10m / 60m / 24h / custom).

Copy button with instant, inline confirmation (“Link copied”). Follow error-message UX rules: visible, constructive (“Try again”), don’t erase user input. 
Nielsen Norman Group

QR button: shows modal with QR + “Save image” and “Copy link”.

Toasts: short auto-dismiss for success; sticky if action required. 
Carbon Design System

Empty/Loading/Skeleton states on /s/{id} to avoid jank.

5) Visual & content guidelines

Tone: calm, factual (“One view only”).

Danger moments:

On create: “Keep the part after # secret; the server never sees it.” (Brief info tooltip.) 
MDN Web Docs

On reveal: “This page will self-destruct when you close it.”

Accessibility: target 4.5:1 text contrast (AA) minimum; strive for 7:1 in body copy (AAA). Provide a “high contrast” toggle.

6) Security UX hardening (frontend)

Headers (set globally):

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload

Content-Security-Policy (nonce + default-src 'self'; disallow inline except nonce’d script)

Referrer-Policy: no-referrer

Cache-Control: no-store

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series

Host protection: only allow your domains via Trusted Host middleware.

Rate limits: show friendly messages, not technical codes; retry-after hints. 
OWASP

API responses: strictly shaped; never include ciphertext back on errors (OWASP excessive exposure).
